This was a quick webapp I hacked together over a Saturday. It is simple enough - a one page application for donating a dollar a week to a designated content creator. It is no longer running live, but you can check out the small codebase here. It have a real-time ticker to track dollars donated for the week as well as a PayPal button that calls PayPals payment API to carry out a donation transaction using PayPals lite client to allow the user to login and submit a donation through their PayPal account. It also offers the ability to pay as a guest using a card.

Seeing as the backend API is no longer running and the Database has been shut down, the real-time ticker will not be active and the content creator information will not appear.
